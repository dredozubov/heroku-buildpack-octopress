Heroku Buildpack Octopress
==============================

A fork of the [official Ruby Buildpack][1] with support for generating an [Octopress][2] static site during the build/deploy stage.

Inspired by the [heroku-buildpack-ruby-octopress][3] from Jason Garber but updated to work with the new Heroku Bundler method of [specifying a Ruby version][4].

Usage
-----
To use this build pack prepare your Octopress install according to the [original instructions][5] from Jason Garber.

```
heroku create --buildpack https://github.com/nicholasmott/heroku-buildpack-octopress.git
```
or add this buildpack to your current app
```
heroku config:add BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/nicholasmott/heroku-buildpack-octopress.git
```

Hacking
-------

To use this buildpack, fork it on Github.  Push up changes to your fork, then create a test app with `--buildpack <your-github-url>` and push to it.

To change the vendored binaries for Bundler, [Node.js](http://github.com/joyent/node), and rails plugins, use the rake tasks provided by the `Rakefile`. You'll need an S3-enabled AWS account and a bucket to store your binaries in as well as the [vulcan](http://github.com/ddollar/vulcan) gem to build the binaries on heroku.

For example, you can change the vendored version of Bundler to 1.1.rc.

First you'll need to build a Heroku-compatible version of Node.js:

    $ export AWS_ID=xxx AWS_SECRET=yyy S3_BUCKET=zzz
    $ s3 create $S3_BUCKET
    $ rake gem:install[bundler,1.1.rc]

Open `lib/language_pack/ruby.rb` in your editor, and change the following line:

    BUNDLER_VERSION = "1.1.rc"

Open `lib/language_pack/base.rb` in your editor, and change the following line:

    VENDOR_URL = "https://s3.amazonaws.com/zzz"

Commit and push the changes to your buildpack to your Github fork, then push your sample app to Heroku to test.  You should see:

    -----> Installing dependencies using Bundler version 1.1.rc

NOTE: You'll need to vendor the plugins, node, Bundler, and libyaml by running the rake tasks for the buildpack to work properly.
=======
    $ git push heroku master
    -----> Heroku receiving push
    -----> Ruby/Rails app detected
    -----> Installing dependencies using Bundler version 1.1.rc
           Running: bundle install --without development:test --path vendor/bundle --deployment
           ...
    -----> Writing config/database.yml to read from DATABASE_URL
    -----> Preparing app for Rails asset pipeline
           Running: rake assets:precompile
    -----> Rails plugin injection
           Injecting rails_log_stdout
           Injecting rails3_serve_static_assets
    -----> Discovering process types
           Procfile declares types      -> web
           Default types for Ruby/Rails -> console, rake, worker

The buildpack will detect your apps as a Rails 3 app if it has an `application.rb` file in the `config` directory.

#### Assets

To enable static assets being served on the dyno, [rails3_serve_static_assets](http://github.com/pedro/rails3_serve_static_assets) is installed by default. If the [execjs gem](http://github.com/sstephenson/execjs) is detected then [node.js](http://github.com/joyent/node) will be vendored. The `assets:precompile` rake task will get run if no `public/manifest.yml` is detected.  See [this article](http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/rails31_heroku_cedar) on how rails 3.1 works on cedar.

Flow
----
The buildpack adds the octopress `generate` task after `rake assets:precompile` task in the Ruby language pack.

The Rack language pack is then invoked by the `config.ru` file which runs the Sinatra Static Server to serve the generated files.

Rails 2/3 language packs remain in place but will be ignored.
